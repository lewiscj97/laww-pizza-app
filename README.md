# Department for Work and Pizza

## About

This is a starter project intended for use during the Learning at Work Week (L@WW).

It is a basic project, created using the [govuk-prototype-kit](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/),
that is intended to be built upon by attendees throughout L@WW.

### Government Design System (GDS)

The `govuk-prototype-kit` uses [GDS](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) to resemble a real GOV.UK
application. GDS ensures that a user's journey feels consistent when they access different services
provided by various Government departments.

## To run the project

To start the project, run the following snippet of code in the terminal:

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then, navigate to http://localhost:3000.

## Tests

**Note: the application must be running before tests are executed.**

The test suite uses the [chai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai), [mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) 
and [puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer) dependencies.

```shell
npm test
```
